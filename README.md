# file-organizer
Using the script you will be able to create an executable after inserting the necessary info and you will be able to use it to organize the files on your pc. You can also use it with Task schedules from windows to run it on an interval.

When you open the main.py you will need to update the paths acordingly to the needs you have.
I setup some types of files that are generaly used by all of us, but dont let this to block you creation, add as many as you want to it.

After adding the paths you will need to run into the IDE Terminal "python setup.py build" -> if you want to run it from the command line use the same syntax
